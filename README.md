##### What could be improved

- The UI could be made to look better
  - The elements in the list could be made to look clickable
  - The app could actually have some color
  - The fields on the details page could be formatted into a nicer looking list maybe with bullet points
  - A toolbar to navigate between the pages could be added

- The data source could be wrapped into a repository layer
  - This would allow for easily swapping out with a backend api or something
  - Would also facilitate unit testing

- The view model could be unit tested
